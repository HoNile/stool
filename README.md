# Stool

Stool (Serial tool) is a small utility graphical program to interact with serial ports.

The goals of the project are to test the [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid) library and how it can be used with the async ecosystem from rust.

It is being tested only on Windows but should be cross platform.
